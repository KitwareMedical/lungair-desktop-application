-----------------------------------

#### How to submit a PR ?

If you are new to LungAIR development and you don't have push access to the LungAIR
repository, here are the steps:

1. [Fork and clone][fk] the repository.
3. Create a branch.
4. [Push][push] the branch to your GitHub fork.
5. Create a [Pull Request][pr].

This corresponds to the `Fork & Pull Model` described in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models)
guides.

If you have push access to this repository, you could simply push your branch
and create a [Pull Request][pr]. This corresponds to the `Shared Repository Model`
and will facilitate other developers to checkout your topic without having to
[configure a remote](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/).
It will also simplify the workflow when you are _co-developing_ a branch.
